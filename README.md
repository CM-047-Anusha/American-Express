American Express User Exit Prediction
This project aims to predict user exits (churn) for American Express using data analytics and deep learning. The goal is to develop a predictive model that helps identify customers likely to churn, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

Project Overview
The American Express User Exit Prediction project utilizes deep learning, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to predict customer churn. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a deep learning model to make accurate predictions.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical features to prepare the dataset for the deep learning model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key patterns in customer data, such as spending habits and engagement metrics, to understand churn behavior.
Deep Learning Model (ANN): Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting user exit, optimized with backpropagation and trained on customer data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.


Technologies Used:

Python (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras)
Jupyter Notebook
Deep Learning (ANN)
Data visualization tools for EDA
